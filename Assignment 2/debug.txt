The exec() function is used by the operating system:

1.Initially

Breakpoint 1, exec (path=0x20b01c "/init", argv=0x20cf14) at exec.c:11
11	{
(gdb) 

At this point, the machine is running in 32-bit mode, the xv6 kernel has initialized itself, and it is just about to load and execute its first user-mode process, the /init program.

2.At the second breakpoint

Breakpoint 1, exec (path=0x2056c8 "sh", argv=0x207f14) at exec.c:11
11	{
(gdb) 

The second time the exec function gets called is when the /init program launches the first interactive shell, sh.

3.and why is no breakpoint reached the third time until we execute any of the commands in xv6 operating system

This is because xv6 has started a shell, waiting for a command (we can see a '$' prompt in the qemu terminal), and it will not run to the exec function again until we enter a command, which the shell will call exec to run it.

After we type command ls in qemu we can see the third breakpoint as the shell called exec() to execute the ls command.
Breakpoint 1, exec (path=0x1f40e0 "ls", argv=0x201f14) at exec.c:11
11	{
(gdb)
We can use the backtrace command to trace and list the chain of functions calls that led to the current function.
We can go "up" one call frame to examine the context from which exec was called using the up command.
